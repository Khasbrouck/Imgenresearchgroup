            <p><span>Travis Snyder, DO</span>Owner and Physician Scientist:</p>
            <p>Dr. Snyder works in many capacities: as a diagnostic radiology and neuroradiologist for SimonMed,
                as Director of Research and Director of Neuroradiology at SimonMed, as Assistant Program Director
                for the Radiology Residency Program at Mountainview Hospital, and he holds numerous academic
                appointments in Nevada, California, and Michigan. However, it is in his role as owner of Imgen that
                he can combine his far-reaching vision to advance the field of neuroradiology with his interest in
                improving medical care through teaching and mentoring medical students and residents. Dr.
                Snyder uses his experience with patients and deep understanding of current neuroradiology
                research to steer Imgen projects toward areas that will improve medical diagnosis and prognosis in
                the future.

            <p>Dr. Vanier brings a diverse set of training and experience to her role as CEO of Imgen. She oversees
                the administrative and scientific scope of Imgen, working closely with Dr. Snyder, to discover
                insights that can advance the practice of neuroradiology. As a biostatistician trained in biology and
                experienced in complex experimental design and analysis of high-dimension data, she works with
                every member of the team to ensure the quality of our quantitative work and to clearly
                communicate our findings and their limitations to research and clinical audiences. Dr. Vanier
                comes from a recent stint as Chief Research Officer at Touro University Nevada, and she has been
                heavily involved in helping professional students, graduate students, residents, university faculty,
                and professional scientists design, analyze and communicate their work, producing a wealth of
                professional meeting presentations and 23 professional publications in the past 5 years alone,
                including one in Nature Communications. She has taught courses or lectured in the areas of research
                methods, epidemiology, biostatistics, human subjects research protections, scientific writing,
                introductory biology, and applied biostatistics using R software, among others.

            <p>Thomas Knoblauch brings a strong physics background to his role as Imgen’s Director of Research,
                where he is involved in the development and progression of more than 40 quantitative
                neuroimaging studies. He handles many of the technology-related challenges of involving students
                and other researchers in the field of neuroradiology, and he is the main point of contact for new
                collaborators. One of his many projects is his own PhD project, “”. His work has resulted in
                numerous abstracts for professional meetings and three publications so far.

            <p><span>Alan Rodriguez, MD</span>Director of Medical Science:</p>
            <p>Dr. Rodriguez has a passion for improving medical care through research. As Director of Medical
                Science at Imgen, he is responsible for providing an accurate and up-to-date medical context for the
                neuroradiology research projects we are pursuing. He has worked with numerous students and
                colleagues to produce abstracts for professional meetings and publications regarding neuroimaging
                findings related to carbon monoxide intoxication, Alzheimer’s disease, mild traumatic brain injury,
                and loss of consciousness.

            <p>As a research collaborator, Dr. Santhanam lends support to Imgen’s efforts in neuroimaging data
            processing and analysis, as well as the drafting and editing of manuscripts for peer-reviewed
            publication. Trained in the field of biomedical imaging, with particular emphasis on magnetic
            resonance imaging methods and analysis, she has a strong interest in elucidating the neuronal
            processes underlying brain injury and disease. Over the past 10 years, she has led and contributed
            to multiple neuroimaging research efforts focused on patient outcomes following traumatic brain
            injury.
